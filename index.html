<p>
Where do mango trees grow? The mango tree growing zone is limited to tropical climates. Extended exposure to temperatures below 30°F can kill or severely damage a mango tree, as mango tree cold tolerance is low. So, in the U.S. the mango tree growing zones are the southernmost portions of Florida and California plus Hawaii and Puerto Rico. Fortunately, while mango tree cold tolerance isn’t one its strong suits, mangos are cultivated in mango tree growing zones all around the globe and Americans can enjoy the delicious fruit year ‘round.<br>

How fast do mango trees grow and what is the average mango tree height? A mango tree can grow fairly quickly and quite large, reaching a height of 100 feet or more with a canopy of 35 feet or more. Of course, mango tree growth rate, mango tree growth stages, and mango tree height vary based on soil and weather conditions.

The average mango tree height for those in cultivation is generally much shorter as this makes for a more manageable harvest. But these trees shouldn’t be confused with dwarf mango trees. Dwarf mango tree varieties have naturally small to medium-size trees.<br>

The large leaves of a mango tree are leathery, 5 to 16 inches in length, and remain on the tree for a year or more. Flowers are produced in terminal panicles or clusters 4 to 16 inches long. Each flower is small with white petals and a mild sweet aroma. The flowers are pollinated by insects and less than 1 percent of the flowers will mature to form fruit. A mango fruit tree in full flower in the optimal mango tree growing zone is a beautiful sight indeed.<br>

<h3>
Pine tree
</h3>
<img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0062/8532/8445/products/Norfolk_Island_Pine_5_BB_720x.jpg?v=1607375158" Height="500px" Width="500px">
<p>
	Pine trees are evergreen, coniferous resinous trees (or, rarely, shrubs) growing 3–80 m (10–260 ft) tall, with the majority of species reaching 15–45 m (50–150 ft) tall.[4] The smallest are Siberian dwarf pine and Potosi pinyon, and the tallest is an 81.79 m (268.35 ft) tall ponderosa pine located in southern Oregon's Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest.[5]

Pines are long lived and typically reach ages of 100–1,000 years, some even more. The longest-lived is the Great Basin bristlecone pine, Pinus longaeva. One individual of this species, dubbed "Methuselah", is one of the world's oldest living organisms at around 4,800 years old. This tree can be found in the White Mountains of California.[6] An older tree, now cut down, was dated at 4,900 years old.[7][8] It was discovered in a grove beneath Wheeler Peak and it is now known as "Prometheus" after the Greek immortal.[8] <br>

The spiral growth of branches, needles, and cone scales may be arranged in Fibonacci number ratios.[9][10] The new spring shoots are sometimes called "candles"; they are covered in brown or whitish bud scales and point upward at first, then later turn green and spread outward. These "candles" offer foresters a means to evaluate fertility of the soil and vigour of the trees.

<h3>
Apple tree
</h3>
<img src="https://chiefrivernursery.com/media/catalog/product/cache/9820170e8aaf17063e79ec8448f2da6f/d/o/domestic-apple-hardwood_1.jpg" height="500px" Width="500px">
<p>
The apple is a deciduous tree, generally standing 2 to 4.5 m (6 to 15 ft) tall in cultivation and up to 9 m (30 ft) in the wild. When cultivated, the size, shape and branch density are determined by rootstock selection and trimming method. The leaves are alternately arranged dark green-colored simple ovals with serrated margins and slightly downy undersides.[5]


Apple blossom
Blossoms are produced in spring simultaneously with the budding of the leaves and are produced on spurs and some long shoots. The 3 to 4 cm (1 to 1+1⁄2 in) flowers are white with a pink tinge that gradually fades, five petaled, with an inflorescence consisting of a cyme with 4–6 flowers. The central flower of the inflorescence is called the "king bloom"; it opens first and can develop a larger fruit.[5][6]

The fruit is a pome that matures in late summer or autumn, and cultivars exist in a wide range of sizes. Commercial growers aim to produce an apple that is 7 to 8.5 cm (2+3⁄4 to 3+1⁄4 in) in diameter, due to market preference. Some consumers, especially those in Japan, prefer a larger apple, while apples below 5.5 cm (2+1⁄4 in) are generally used for making juice and have little fresh market value. The skin of ripe apples is generally red, yellow, green, pink, or russetted, though many bi- or tri-colored cultivars may be found.[7] The skin may also be wholly or partly russeted i.e. rough and brown. The skin is covered in a protective layer of epicuticular wax.[8] The exocarp (flesh) is generally pale yellowish-white,[7] though pink, yellow or green exocarps also occur.[9]

<h3>
Pear tree
</h3>
<img src="https://www.homestratosphere.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/common-pear-tree-Apr132021-1-1.jpg" Height= "500px" Width="500px">
<p>
	In most cases, pear tree is a deciduous tree (it loses its leaves seasonally) that can grow up to 40 feet (12 meters) tall or even more. Nearly all pear trees that are cultivated for fruits are deciduous, but there are few cultivars (mostly ornamental) that are evergreen. Pear tree is a member of Rosaceae family. The blossoms are produced in spring. The fruits mature on shoots that are 2 or more years old. They mature in late summer or autumn depending on the variety. The average pear tree is able to produce notable quantity of fruits from the 4th – 6th year of its age and can continue to do so until the 30th-40th year of its age.

Pear trees are believed to be cultivated since the 1st century BC, mainly in Asia. Its wide spread is caused partly because pear tree is very flexible, resilient and resistant to cold and draught, but not as much as apple tree is. About 70% of world pear production takes place in China, but pear trees are also cultivated in North and South America, Europe and Turkey. Pyrus communis, Pyrus pyrifolia and Pyrus bretschneider represent more than 95% of trees that are globally grown for fruits. However, there are more than 2500 known cultivars.

<h3>
Cherry tree
</h3>

<p>
Like most temperate-latitude trees, cherry trees require a certain number of chilling hours each year to break dormancy and bloom and produce fruit. The number of chilling hours required depends on the variety. Because of this cold-weather requirement, no members of the genus Prunus can grow in tropical climates. (See "production" section for more information on chilling requirements)

Cherries have a short growing season and can grow in most temperate latitudes.[12] Cherries blossom in April (in the Northern Hemisphere) and the peak season for the cherry harvest is in the summer. In southern Europe in June, in North America in June, in England in mid-July, and in southern British Columbia (Canada) in June to mid-August. In many parts of North America, they are among the first tree fruits to flower and ripen in mid-Spring.

In the Southern Hemisphere, cherries are usually at their peak in late December and are widely associated with Christmas. 'Burlat' is an early variety which ripens during the beginning of December, 'Lapins' ripens near the end of December, and 'Sweetheart' finish slightly later.[13]

<h3>
Banana tree
</h3>
<img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2045/8185/products/11462684_a93f75e9-3c31-4644-84b2-90eb3467b9a2_600x600.jpg?v=1607088750" Height="500px" Width="500px">
<p>
In the 15th and 16th centuries, Portuguese colonists started banana plantations in the Atlantic Islands, Brazil, and western Africa.[68] North Americans began consuming bananas on a small scale at very high prices shortly after the Civil War, though it was only in the 1880s that the food became more widespread.[69] As late as the Victorian Era, bananas were not widely known in Europe, although they were available.[68] Jules Verne introduces bananas to his readers with detailed descriptions in Around the World in Eighty Days (1872).

The earliest modern plantations originated in Jamaica and the related Western Caribbean Zone, including most of Central America. It involved the combination of modern transportation networks of steamships and railroads with the development of refrigeration that allowed more time between harvesting and ripening. North American shippers like Lorenzo Dow Baker and Andrew Preston, the founders of the Boston Fruit Company started this process in the 1870s, but railroad builders like Minor C. Keith also participated, eventually culminating in the multi-national giant corporations like today's Chiquita Brands International and Dole.[69] These companies were monopolistic, vertically integrated (meaning they controlled growing, processing, shipping and marketing) and usually used political manipulation to build enclave economies (economies that were internally self-sufficient, virtually tax exempt, and export-oriented that contribute very little to the host economy). Their political maneuvers, which gave rise to the term Banana republic for states like Honduras and Guatemala, included working with local elites and their rivalries to influence politics or playing the international interests of the United States, especially during the Cold War, to keep the political climate favorable to their interests.

<h3>
Coconut tree
</h3>

<p>
Cocos nucifera is a large palm, growing up to 30 m (100 ft) tall, with pinnate leaves 4–6 m (13–20 ft) long, and pinnae 60–90 cm (2–3 ft) long; old leaves break away cleanly, leaving the trunk smooth.[41] On fertile soil, a tall coconut palm tree can yield up to 75 fruits per year, but more often yields less than 30.[42][43][44] Given proper care and growing conditions, coconut palms produce their first fruit in six to ten years, taking 15 to 20 years to reach peak production.[45]

True-to-type dwarf varieties of Pacific coconuts have been cultivated by the Austronesian peoples since ancient times. These varieties were selected for slower growth, sweeter coconut water, and often brightly-colored fruits.[46] Many modern different varieties are also grown, including the Maypan coconut, King coconut, and Macapuno. These vary by the taste of the coconut water and color of the fruit, as well as other genetic factors.

<h3>
Fig tree

<img src="https://www.calloways.com/wp-content/uploads/fig-tree-26097.jpg" Height="500px" Width="500px">
<p>
Figs are keystone species in many tropical forest ecosystems. Their fruit are a key resource for some frugivores including fruit bats, and primates including: capuchin monkeys, langurs, gibbons and mangabeys. They are even more important for birds such as Asian barbets, pigeons, hornbills, fig-parrots and bulbuls, which may almost entirely subsist on figs when these are in plenty. Many Lepidoptera caterpillars feed on fig leaves, for example several Euploea species (crow butterflies), the plain tiger (Danaus chrysippus), the giant swallowtail (Papilio cresphontes), the brown awl (Badamia exclamationis), and Chrysodeixis eriosoma, Choreutidae and Copromorphidae moths. The citrus long-horned beetle (Anoplophora chinensis), for example, has larvae that feed on wood, including that of fig trees; it can become a pest in fig plantations. Similarly, the sweet potato whitefly (Bemisia tabaci) is frequently found as a pest on figs grown as potted plants and is spread through the export of these plants to other localities.

<p>
A spruce is a tree of the genus Picea /paɪˈsiːə/,[1] a genus of about 35 species of coniferous evergreen trees in the family Pinaceae, found in the northern temperate and boreal (taiga) regions of the Earth. Picea is the sole genus in the subfamily Piceoideae. Spruces are large trees, from about 20 to 60 m (about 60–200 ft) tall when mature, and have whorled branches and conical form. They can be distinguished from other members of the pine family by their needles (leaves), which are four-sided and attached singly to small persistent peg-like structures (pulvini or sterigmata[2]) on the branches, and by their cones (without any protruding bracts), which hang downwards after they are pollinated.[3] The needles are shed when 4–10 years old, leaving the branches rough with the retained pegs. In other similar genera, the branches are fairly smooth.

Spruce are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera (moth and butterfly) species, such as the eastern spruce budworm. They are also used by the larvae of gall adelgids (Adelges species).

In the mountains of western Sweden, scientists have found a Norway spruce, nicknamed Old Tjikko, which by reproducing through layering, has reached an age of 9,550 years and is claimed to be the world's oldest known living tree.[4]

<h3>
Cedar tree

<p>
Cedar is part of the English common name of many trees and other plants, particularly those of the genus Cedrus.

Some botanical authorities consider Cedrus the only "true cedars".[1] Many other species with similarly aromatic wood, including several species of genera Calocedrus, Thuja, and Chamaecyparis in the Pacific Northwest, are referred to as "false cedars".[2]

<h3>
Oak tree

<p>
An oak is a tree or shrub in the genus Quercus (/ˈkwɜːrkəs/;[1] Latin "oak tree") of the beech family, Fagaceae. There are approximately 500 extant species of oaks.[2] The common name "oak" also appears in the names of species in related genera, notably Lithocarpus (stone oaks), as well as in those of unrelated species such as Grevillea robusta (silky oaks) and the Casuarinaceae (she-oaks). The genus Quercus is native to the Northern Hemisphere, and includes deciduous and evergreen species extending from cool temperate to tropical latitudes in the Americas, Asia, Europe, and North Africa. North America has the largest number of oak species, with approximately 160 species in Mexico of which 109 are endemic and about 90 in the United States. The second greatest area of oak diversity is China, with approximately 100 species.[3]

Oak: male flowers

The leaves of a young oak
Oaks have spirally arranged leaves, with lobate margins in many species; some have serrated leaves or entire leaves with smooth margins. Many deciduous species are marcescent, not dropping dead leaves until spring. In spring, a single oak tree produces both male flowers (in the form of catkins) and small female flowers,[4] meaning that the trees are monoecious. The fruit is a nut called an acorn or oak nut borne in a cup-like structure known as a cupule; each acorn contains one seed (rarely two or three) and takes 6–18 months to mature, depending on their species. The acorns and leaves contain tannic acid,[5] which helps to guard from fungi and insects.[6] The live oaks are distinguished for being evergreen, but are not actually a distinct group and instead are dispersed across the genus.
